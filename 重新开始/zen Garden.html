    Here  are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

    - CSS3? Of course! prefix for All browsers where necessary.
    - go responsive;test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
    - your browsers testing baseline:IE9+,recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari,and iOS/Android
    - Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
    - use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
    - web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files.Hosted
      services that are applied via the CSS file(ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
      most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this 
      page for useage instructions:http://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

    And a few tips on building your CSS file:

    -use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to  get at non-classed elements
    -use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
    -use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
    -use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
    -don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.
